# What is Frost?

The common Ember platform for Ciena web development teams, with dedicated UX and visual design teams and a large community of contributing developers.  Frost is also a major step forward in Ciena's evolution as a software organization as the majority of this platform will be open source.

### General tools

[ember-cli-blanket](https://github.com/sglanzer/ember-cli-blanket)  
[ember-prop-types]()  
[ember-pollboy]()  
[ember-block-slots]()  
[webdriverio]()  
See [ciena-blueplanet]() for additional projects

### App components and patterns

# Where is Frost going?

As with software development in general, Frost is a journey not a destination.  We're constantly refining our designs and technical skills and Frost is a reflection of this progression.  We want to collaborate as a community, have our ideas challenged and continually evolve the platform.

That said, no platform can be all things to all people, so Frost focuses on the following key concepts:

### Visual design conventions

Frost backs large, data-driven tools and we believe that a single high-quality visual design is more valuable to the building of these tools than visual customization.  We aren't intending on competing with the excellent existing products focused on customization, such as Bootstrap or Foundation.  Instead, we intend to make the construction of complex visual patterns a more accessible process by allowing developers to focus less on visuals and more on solving use cases.  Frost allows customization of color themes, but will be fairly proscriptive over the look and behavior of components.

### Language conventions

We love the Ember community and all of the addons available are incredibly inspiring; however, addons often have different interface conventions and remembering the conventions can be challenging.  All of the components in Frost will present a consistent style of interface, whether the component is original to Frost or an interface shim around a community addon.

### Extending beyond core components

This is where the benefits of following conventions comes into play.  Beyond the core of Frost is an ecosystem of complex components that build off  of the core.  Data driven forms, filter/sort/list browsers, component based svg visualizations, geo-map overlays; a constantly expanding list of solutions with accessible designs ready to be plugged into Frost based applications.  

### Robustness and developer support

None of these concepts are any good unless they can be relied on.  Frost projects will contain comprehensive behavioral and visual tests for each component and tool, backed by useful measures of coverage and complexity.  We have passionate developers that focus on making these standards easy to scaffold and maintain - stay tuned for open source releases and blogs that make these tools and processes accessible to the community.


# Suggestions? Ideas?

Does any of this sound appealing?  Want to participate?  We're always open to ideas and we love talking about designs.  Propose a component, work with us to build something, tell us we've got it all wrong - we want to collaborate with and be challenged by you.
