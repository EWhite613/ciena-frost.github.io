When to use

The sort component should be available whenever an object browser is used. It should be visible for both the list browser and the table browser. The table browser will have the added functionality of allowing the user to click on the column headings to sort individual columns. When the user clicks on a header, the sort component will respond accordingly and show the newly sorted column name.

Use cases
=========

1.  User only chooses to sort on one column, but will frequently change that column.
2.  User will sort by 2-3 columns at a time
3.  User will want to quickly remove or change their sort

 

How to use
==========

1.  First item in sort, will be set by default
2.  Button drop down for user to select adding additional sort attributes
3.  Easy removal option for user
4.  Secondary sort, user could add as many levels of sort as they have attributes
5.  Selection list for use to easily change the attribute they are sorting on
