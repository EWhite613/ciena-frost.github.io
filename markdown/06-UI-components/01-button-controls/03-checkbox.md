## Behaviors

-   Selecting and deselecting the checkbox will display the checkmark or hide the checkmark.

## Usage guidelines

**A checkbox is used to choose between two opposite states, actions or values.** 

<span class="s1">A checkbox designed to be used in a UI window such as a filter pane, forms or dialogues. </span>

Checkboxes can be combined with radio buttons. 

To provide a set a choices from which you can choose only one option, please use radio buttons (<span style="color: rgb(0,0,255);">radio button</span>).

To make it clear for the user to understand the options, always use a text label for each checkbox that is placed to the right of the check box. It should be clear to the user of what happens when the option is selected or deselected. And, always use sentence style capitalization for the text label. Also, it is recommended to provide text label that introduces a group of checkboxes and clearly describes the set of choices they represent.

In addition to group label, use the appropriate spacing between a group of checkboxes to show how the are related.

Always arrange checkboxes in a column; therefore always arrange them vertically to make it easier to distinguish on state from another. 

 

Checkboxes have four different states:

**Normal:** This is the default state of the checkbox

**Hover:** Use this state to show that the user is hovering over the text field with a mouse.

**Focus:** Use this state to show that the user has selected the password text field either by tabbing to it or selecting it with the mouse.

**Disabled:** When the checkbox option is temporary unavailable.

**Error:** When a checkbox option is a required field and the user hasn't checked the option prior to continuing his workflow. Use the error checkbox to visual indicate to the user that this is a required field.
