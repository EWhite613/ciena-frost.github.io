## Behaviors

-   A text area field is a rectangular area in which the user enters text or modifies existing text. It is multiple lines in height as opposed to being a single line.
-   Text will wrap within the text area field
-   If the inputted characters are more than can be displayed, a scroll bar will be displayed.
-   If disabled text is displayed, the scroll bar is still operational.
-   There is no option to display hidden characters for a text area field.
-   There is no option for auto-completion in the text area field.
-   A text area field can be validated to provide error state and error text below the text area field.
-   For a text area field that is already populated with text, selecting in the text field will highlight the whole contents.
-   An X is displayed at the bottom right corner of the text area field to clear the inputted characters.

## Guidelines

**Text areas are typically used to collect more lengthy textual input from a user.** An example where the text area field would be used is a note, where free form text that can vary from several characters to sentences.

See [text field](#/ui-components/input-controls/text) usage guidelines. The same usage guidelines apply, but might not be as relevant.

**Text area field should be at least 2 lines in height.**

**The length of the text area field will depend on the the context it is being used in**. General rule is 50% of the expected content. It needs to be a reasonable size so it is long enough to accept input. Seek professional help. 

**A scroll bar is displayed when text is longer than the text area field**.
