# When to use

The global search will always be available from the Application Bar. The application bar will be the only constant on every page within Blue Planet. The global search will give the user the freedom to search on anything they want. Very similar to a google search where a user can search on a specific word, and see what is returned, but also allowing the user to be more specific.

# UX interaction

When a user clicks on the "Search" icon in the application bar, a text field will appear for the user to type their search keywords. Once a user hits the enter key, results will replace the contents on the current page and be returned in the form of a [list browser](https://confluence.ciena.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=167240510). The list browser will provide specific information based on the data object types returned by the search. The keywords used in the search will appear in the keyword text field in the center of the info bar on the results page. The user will have the ability to "reset" the global search at any time by clearing and entering a new **keyword search** from the list browser, or by accessing the **global search** from the application bar.
