# When to use

The "About" screen is a basic informational dialog available in any Blue Planet installation.  Blue Planet will always offer an about screen to give further details about what is installed.  Users and support staff may consult this for clarity on specific versions, installed components, copyright information and 3rdparty legal attributions, as needed.   In the field, this information is most useful in the context of a support request.

# UX/UI Components

1.  **Logo/spectrum strip:** the full Blue Planet marketing logo with Blue Planet spectrum strip
2.  **Version:** Blue Planet version
3.  **Legal text:** includes copyright & trademark
4.  **Close button**

# Interaction design

The About screen is accessible via the application bar's System menu.  Once opened, it opens the "About" content into a modal dialog.

 

# Future considerations

**In the future** there may be a link from the about dialog to display the full system info including installed solutions/application modules, micro-services and their versions.

**Users may be able to view more detailed system information** about installed components, their versions and even 3rdparty components installed.  This would most likely be used when interacting with Ciena support.

Today we are just displaying the Blue Planet version number.
